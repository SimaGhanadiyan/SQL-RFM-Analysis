1. Sales by Product Line
This section groups sales by product line, providing insights into revenue distribution across different product categories.

2. Sales by Year

3. Sales by Deal Size
Groups sales by deal size, helping to understand the distribution of revenue based on the size of deals.

4. Best Month for Sales in a Specific Year
Identifies the best month for sales in a particular year and provides details on the revenue earned during that month.

5. Product Sales in a Specific Month
Focuses on the best month for sales (November) and breaks down sales by product line for that month.

6. Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
Utilizes RFM analysis to segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values. Differentiates customers into categories such as 'lost,' 'churning,' 'new,' 'active,' and 'loyal.'

7. Frequently Sold Together
Identifies products that are often sold together by examining order numbers and associated product codes.
